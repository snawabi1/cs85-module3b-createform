// Output prediction: I expect a thank-you message showing name, topic, and email.
// $_POST contents: fullname, email, topic, message
// Reflections: I learned how to sanitize/validate form data using PHP.
// I had to fix a bug where the file was wrong in file during testing 3/ i had it in 3b.
// Surprises: Also going through submission instructions once everything was done I noticed I needed to commit
// as I went along so I moved everything to another file before I was going to send the entire file and added chunks
// this caused a some delay as it was done at last minute. 
// Insights: future note to self: read the sumbission instructions first before assignment instructions.
